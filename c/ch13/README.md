Running jobs on CLUSTER
=======================

The only thin in this subdirectory is a sample batch script for running codes
from previous Chapters.

CLUSTER is a modest-sized Linux cluster at the University of Alaska Fairbanks,
namely

    http://www.gi.alaska.edu/research-computing-systems/hpc/chinook

Access is generally limited to UAF students and faculty.  Thus this batch
script is _only_ an example which might be useful as a suggestion for how
PETSc codes are run on many-node machines.
