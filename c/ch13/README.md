Running jobs on CLUSTER
=======================

The only thing in this subdirectory is a sample batch script for running codes
from previous Chapters.

CLUSTER is a modest-sized Linux cluster at the University of Alaska Fairbanks:

Access is generally limited to UAF students and faculty.  Thus this batch
script is _only_ an example which might be useful as a suggestion for how
PETSc codes are run on many-node machines.
