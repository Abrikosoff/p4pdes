# A box with a bump along the bottom.  Suitable for meshing with *triangle*:
#     http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html
# Do this to generate mesh:
#     triangle -pqa1.0 bump
# To view the result do
#     showme bump &
# to generate very coarse mesh.  To generate a finer mesh with element area
# an order of magnitude smaller, do
#     triangle -pqa0.1 bump
# To regenerate the first very coarse mesh and then refine it by a factor of
# two, do
#     triangle -pqa1.0 bump    # creates bump.1.{node,ele,poly}
#     triangle -rpa0.5 bump.1  # creates bump.2.{node,ele,poly}
#     showme bump &            # click through 0,1,2 levels

# All nine segments on boundary are marked so *triangle* can work with the
