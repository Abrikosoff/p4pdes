solving on 17 x 16 grid with dx=0.0625 x dy=0.0625 cells ...
t0=0. and initial step dt=0.01 (so D0 dt / (min{dx,dy}^2) = 2.56)
  energy = 0.00e+00
  energy = 2.56e-14
  energy = 1.10e-13
  energy = 1.18e-13
  energy = 1.22e-13
  energy = 1.25e-13
  energy = 1.27e-13
  energy = 1.29e-13
  energy = 1.30e-13
  energy = 1.31e-13
  energy = 1.32e-13
... done ... final time tf=0.1
