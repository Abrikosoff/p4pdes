solving on 17 x 16 grid with dx=0.0625 x dy=0.0625 cells
  and time axis  0.:0.1:0.01  (note: D0 dt / (dx dy) = 2.56) ...
  energy = 0.00e+00
  energy = 1.29e-14
  energy = 3.07e-14
  energy = 3.58e-14
  energy = 3.94e-14
  energy = 4.23e-14
  energy = 4.47e-14
  energy = 4.65e-14
  energy = 4.78e-14
  energy = 4.87e-14
  energy = 4.94e-14
