For now this is just a list so I do not forget.  Alphabetical by last name:

* *Celso Alvizui*: helpful comments on first few chapters
* *Jed Brown*: found PETSc for me originally; advice
* *Elizabeth Greenspan*: shepherd book through manuscript stages
* *Constantine Khroulev*: many detailed comments; general expertise on all matters; guru
* *Matt Knepley*: advice on source code formatting; see also https://bitbucket.org/knepley/understanding-parallel-performance
* *Patrick Sanan*: helpful high-level comments; see un-answered email of 10/11/15
* *Barry Smith*: encouragement, comments, and advice

Generally, a good thing to look at near publication is all issues at github.
