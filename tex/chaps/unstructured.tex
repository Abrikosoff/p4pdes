This section returns to the linear 2D Poisson equation last seen in Chapter \ref{chap:st}, but now for general domains and unstructured grids.  We use \PETSc for new tasks including reading a mesh from a file into \PETSc \pVecs, managing unstructured indexing of that mesh, and implementation of Neumann conditions.  The triangle-based finite element method here contrasts with the structured rectangular-element ($Q^1$) method of Chapter \ref{chap:of}.

This example shows that it is possible to avoid using \PETSc's \pDMDA or other mesh-topology infrastructure, but our work-load increases.  Nonetheless, the current material is representative of many \PETSc applications where direct contact with file formats from outside \PETSc is required.  In this case, we use the well-known, and relatively simple, \texttt{triangle} program for generating unstructured triangular meshes in 2D.  By contrast, in Chapter \ref{chap:dp} we will return to unstructured FEM methods, but in 3D and taking advantage of \PETSc's \pDMPlex class.


\section{A general 2D Poisson problem}

\begin{marginfigure}
\input{tikz/generalpoissondomain.tex}
\caption{Problem \eqref{eq:un:poissonstrong} on a domain.}
\label{fig:un:generalpoissondomain}
\end{marginfigure}

Let $\Omega \subset \RR^2$ be a bounded (open) region.  Suppose its boundary $\partial\Omega$ is well-behaved, for instance it is Lipschitz-continuous \citep[section 1.2]{Ciarlet2002} or even polygonal.  Suppose $\partial\Omega$ is decomposed into (measurable) disjoint subsets $\partial_D \Omega$ and $\partial_N \Omega$ whose union is the entire boundary $\partial \Omega$.  The strong form of the \emph{Poisson problem}, including nonhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, is
\begin{align}
- \grad^2 u &= f \quad \text{ on } \Omega, \label{eq:un:poissonstrong} \\
u &= g_D \quad \text{ on } \partial_D \Omega, \notag \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &= g_N \quad \text{ on } \partial_N \Omega. \notag
\end{align}
Here $\bn$ is the outward unit normal on $\partial \Omega$ and, by definition, $\partial u/\partial n = \bn \cdot \grad u$.

The data of problem \eqref{eq:un:poissonstrong}, besides the region $\Omega$ and its boundary, includes a \emph{source term} $f\in L^2(\Omega)$, \emph{Dirichlet data} $g_D\in L^2(\partial_D \Omega)$, and \emph{Neumann data} $g_N \in L^2(\partial_N \Omega)$.  Poisson problem \eqref{poissonsquare} in Chapter \ref{chap:st} is the homogeneous Dirichlet case where $\Omega$ is the square, $\partial_D \Omega = \partial \Omega$, $\partial_N \Omega = \emptyset$, and $g=0$.  Problem \eqref{eq:un:poissonstrong} is not the most general linear Poisson problem because, specifically, one could require boundary conditions which combine the above with coefficients, e.g.~``$\alpha u + \beta \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = \gamma$ where, generally, $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ could vary along the boundary \citep{Elmanetal2005}.

As \eqref{eq:un:poissonstrong} is stated there may be no solution where ``$\grad^2 u$'' makes sense as a continuous function, even for polygonal regions, continuous boundary values, and continuous source functions.  In particular, there may be no $u\in C^2(\Omega) \cap C(\overline \Omega)$ so that $-\grad^2 u = f$.  There is, however, a solution if we convert \eqref{eq:un:poissonstrong} to a \emph{weak formulation}.  We last saw a weak formulation in Chapter \ref{chap:of}, where it arose as the gradient of an objective function.  In this chapter we will derive it from the strong form in the traditional way, by multiplying by a test function and integrating.

Recall $L^2(\Omega)$ is the space of all square-integrable real functions on $\Omega$.  Define the following Sobolev space \citep{Evans2010} which is also a Hilbert space:
    $$H^1(\Omega) = \left\{u \,:\, u \in L^2(\Omega) \,\&\, \grad u \in L^2(\Omega)\right\}.$$
Definition \eqref{eq:of:sobolevdefn} of $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ gives $W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ as alternate notation for $H^1(\Omega)$.

We use two subsets of $H^1(\Omega)$: \emph{trial functions} come from $H_{gD}^1(\Omega)$, which denotes the functions with value $g_D$ along $\partial_D \Omega$, and \emph{test functions} come from $H_{0D}^1(\Omega)$, with value $0$ along $\partial_D \Omega$.  Note that $H_{0D}^1(\Omega)$ is a linear subspace of $H^1(\Omega)$ while generally $H_{gD}^1(\Omega)$ is not.

To weakly-formulate the Poisson problem we choose any $v\in H_{0D}^1(\Omega)$, multiply the first equation in \eqref{eq:un:poissonstrong} by $v$, and integrate by parts:
\begin{equation*}
\int_\Omega \grad u \cdot \grad v - \int_{\partial\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v = \int_\Omega f v.
\end{equation*}
Next we use the boundary information, namely that $v=0$ on $\partial_D\Omega$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=g_N$ on $\partial_N\Omega$ to get this characterization of $u$:
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \grad u \cdot \grad v = \int_\Omega f v + \int_{\partial_N\Omega} g_N v\quad \text{ for any } v\in H_{0D}^1(\Omega). \label{eq:un:poissonweak}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:un:poissonweak} is the \emph{weak formulation}, and any $u \in H_{gD}^1(\Omega)$ satisfying it is a \emph{weak solution}.  A key observation is that we include the Dirichlet boundary condition by requiring $u$ to live in $H_{gD}^1(\Omega)$.  By contrast, both the Neumann boundary data $g_N$ and the source function $f$ explicitly appear in \eqref{eq:un:poissonweak}.

The rules for passing between the strong \eqref{eq:un:poissonstrong} and weak \eqref{eq:un:poissonweak} formulations clarify the situation:\begin{itemize}
\item A function $u \in C^2(\Omega) \cap C(\overline \Omega)$ is well-behaved enough to possibly satisfy the conditions of the strong form.  If it does, then the above derivation shows it solves the weak form.
\item If $u \in H_{gD}^1(\Omega)$ solves the weak form then we accept it, by definition, as a solution of the Poisson problem, and, in informal speaking, one might even say that it solves \eqref{eq:un:poissonstrong}.  If also it is well-behaved (i.e.~$u \in C^2(\Omega) \cap C(\overline \Omega)$) then reversing the above derivation shows that it solves the strong form.
\end{itemize}

If $\partial_D \Omega$ has positive size, in an appropriate sense, then a solution to weak formulation \eqref{eq:un:poissonweak} exists and is unique (\emph{well-posedness}; \citep{Ciarlet2002,Evans2010}).  There exist conditions on the domain and the boundary data under which one can show $u$ solving \eqref{eq:un:poissonweak} is in $C^2(\Omega) \cap C(\overline \Omega)$ (\emph{regularity}; \citep{Evans2010}).  Reminiscent of Chapter \ref{chap:of}, we could re-formulate our Poisson problem as a minimization; the standard way of doing this gives a formulation equivalent to the weak form \citep{Evans2010}.  However, because our goal in this Chapter is to actually implement a numerical method for \eqref{eq:un:poissonweak}, so that we can examine computational options and performance, we follow none of these mathematical tangents.


\section{A finite element method}

A FEM for the Poisson problem comes from requiring the weak formulation \eqref{eq:un:poissonweak} to be true for $u$ in a finite-dimensional (i.e.~small) subspace of $H_{gD}^1(\Omega)$, and for test functions $v$ ranging over a basis of a finite-dimensional subspace of $H_{0D}^1(\Omega)$.  In the \emph{Galerkin} method here, these subspaces will essentially be the same.  We will build them from triangulations of $\Omega$.

\begin{marginfigure}
\input{tmp/blob.tikz}
\caption{An example polygonal domain $\Omega$ resembling the domain in Figure \ref{fig:un:generalpoissondomain}.  The bold part of the boundary is $\partial_D\Omega$, and $\partial_N\Omega$ is the remainder.}
\label{fig:un:polygon}
\end{marginfigure}

To make our test function space $H_{0D}^1(\Omega)$ a true subspace of $H^1(\Omega)$---so as to make our FEM \emph{conforming}---we require that $\Omega$ be polygonal, with $\partial\Omega$ a closed polygon (Figure \ref{fig:un:polygon}).  Furthermore we require that segments of $\partial\Omega$ be either entirely in $\partial_D\Omega$ or entirely in $\partial_N\Omega$.  We also assume $\partial_D\Omega$ is a closed set for reasons which will be clarified below.

By definition, a \emph{triangulation} is a finite set of non-overlapping, non-empty open triangles $\triangle_k\subset \RR^2$ which tile $\Omega$:
\begin{equation*}
\Th = \left\{\triangle_k \quad\Big|\quad \cup_k \overline{\triangle}_k = \overline{\Omega} \quad \text{ and} \quad \Omega_k \cap \Omega_l = \emptyset \text{ if } k\ne l\right\}.
\end{equation*}
We index the $K$ triangles (elements) in $\Th$ by $k=0,\dots,K-1$.  The $N$ vertices (nodes) in $\Th$ are indexed by $j=0,1,\dots,N-1$, with locations
\begin{equation*}
\bx_j = (x_j,y_j).
\end{equation*}

An example triangulation $\Th$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:un:number-mesh}.  The reader may regard the subscript ``$h$'' in ``$\Th$'' as merely traditional notation, but it denotes the typical or maximum size $h$ (e.g.~diameter) of the triangles; it serves as a reminder that we want to approximate the solution in the limit $h\to 0$.  In contrast to many references--e.g.~\citet{Elmanetal2005}, which we follow in many ways---note that all numbering is zero-based, which is natural in a C implementation, of course.  (As mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap:ls}, in this book even rows and columns of vectors and matrices have numbering starting with zero.)

\begin{marginfigure}
\input{tmp/blob.1.elenum.tikz}

\medskip

\input{tmp/blob.1.nodenum.tikz}
\caption{A triangulation of the polygon in Figure \ref{fig:un:polygon}, shown with element numbering (top) and node numbering (bottom).  There are $K=15$ elements, $N=13$ nodes, and $L=4$ nodes in the Dirichlet boundary $\partial_D\Omega$ (bold).}
\label{fig:un:number-mesh}
\end{marginfigure}

We have informally called the triangles ``elements,'' but in truth the function space we choose on each element is part of the definition.  Here we will use $P^1$ finite elements \citep{Elmanetal2005} so that our test and trial functions are continuous and linear on each triangle $\triangle_k$.  As in Chapter \ref{chap:of}, for each node $j$ there is a basis (``hat'') function  $\psi_j(x,y)$ which is linear on each triangle, continuous on all of $\overline{\Omega}$, and equal to one at only one node $j$,
\begin{equation*}
\psi_j(\bx_i) = \delta_{ij}.
\end{equation*}
See Figure \ref{fig:un:hatfunction}.  The functions $\psi_j$ are in $H^1(\Omega)$, with piecewise-constant partial derivatives $\partial\psi_j/\partial x$ and $\partial\psi_j/\partial y$.  The set $\{\psi_j\}_{j=0,\dots,N-1}$ is linearly-independent.  On each triangle, $\psi_j$ has three degrees of freedom; there exist coefficients $A_{kj},B_{kj},C_{kj}\in\RR$ so that
\begin{equation*}
\psi_j(x,y) = A_{kj} + B_{kj} x + C_{kj} y \quad \text{ on } \triangle_k.
\end{equation*}

Hat functions allow us to interpolate and extend the Dirichlet data $g_D$ from its node values in $\partial_D \Omega$ to the whole of $\overline\Omega$, a step which will be useful in our FEM implementation.  We number the $L$ nodes which are in the Dirichlet boundary by $\bx_{j_l} \in \partial_D\Omega$ for $l=0,\dots,L-1$.  (Figure \ref{fig:un:number-elements} shows an example with $L=4$ and $j_l=l$ for $l=0,1,2,3$.)  Now let $\hat g_D \in C(\overline\Omega)$ be the piecewise-linear interpolant of $g_D$ which has value zero at all nodes $\bx_j$ which are not in the Dirichlet boundary $\partial_D \Omega$:
\begin{equation}
\hat g_D(x,y) = \sum_{l=0}^{L-1} g_D(\bx_{j_l}) \psi_{j_l}(x,y). \label{eq:un:hatgdefine}
\end{equation}

\begin{marginfigure}
\input{tikz/hatfunction.tex}
\caption{Hat functions $\psi_j$.}
\label{fig:un:hatfunction}
\end{marginfigure}

By using $\hat g$ and the basis functions $\psi_j$, we can specify the two needed finite-dimensional subspaces as the span of certain hat functions.  The test functions are zero along $\partial_D \Omega$,
\begin{align*}
S_{0D}^h &= \left<\psi_j \,:\, \bx_j \notin \partial_D \Omega\right> \\
         &= \left<\psi_j \,:\, j \neq j_l \text{ for } l=0,\dots,L-1\right>,
\end{align*}
while the trial functions have value $g_D$ along $\partial_D \Omega$,
\begin{equation}
S_{gD}^h = \left\{\hat g_D + w \,:\, w \in S_{0D}^h\right\}.
\end{equation}
We will seek $u\in S_{gD}^h$.  Note that $\dim(S_{0D}^h)=\dim(S_{gD}^h)=N-L$, and that $S_{0D}^h$ is a linear subspace of $H_{0D}^1(\Omega)$, while $S_{gD}^h$ is merely an affine subspace of $H^1(\Omega)$.

The FEM itself can now be stated.  It requires \eqref{eq:un:poissonweak} to be true for $u^h\in S_{gD}^h$ for all $v^h\in S_{0D}^h$.  However, it suffices to consider $v^h$ from a basis of $S_{0D}^h$, so
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \grad u^h \cdot \grad \psi_i = \int_\Omega f \psi_i + \int_{\partial_N\Omega} g_N \psi_i
\end{equation}
for all $i$ such that $\bx_i \notin \partial_D \Omega$.  Now we write $u^h$ using $N-L$ unknown coefficients $u_j\in\RR$:
\begin{equation}
u^h(x,y) = \hat g_D(x,y) + \sum_{\bx_j \notin \partial_D \Omega} u_j\, \psi_j(x,y). \label{eq:un:uhexpand}
\end{equation}
Moving the known Dirichlet data to the right, and using expansions \eqref{eq:un:hatgdefine} and \eqref{eq:un:uhexpand}, gives
\begin{align}
\sum_{\bx_j \notin \partial_D \Omega} u_j \int_\Omega \grad \psi_j \cdot \grad \psi_i &= \int_\Omega f \psi_i + \int_{\partial_N\Omega} g_N \psi_i \label{eq:un:poissonfem} \\
&\qquad - \sum_{l=0}^{L-1} g_D(\bx_{j_l})  \int_\Omega \grad \psi_{j_l} \cdot \grad \psi_i \notag
\end{align}
The coefficients $u_j$ are the unknowns in these equations.

Note that the support (i.e.~nonzero set) of $\psi_j$ includes only the node $\bx_j$ and all triangles (elements) $\triangle_k$ for which $\bx_j$ is a node of $\triangle_k$.  Thus the integral ``$\int_\Omega \grad \psi_j \cdot \grad \psi_i$'' in \eqref{eq:un:poissonfem} is often zero.  Specifically, it is zero if $\bx_i$ and $\bx_j$ are not both nodes of at least one triangle in the triangulation, so \eqref{eq:un:poissonfem} is (generically) a sparse system of equations.

Each equation in \eqref{eq:un:poissonfem} is linear.  It is therefore very common to immediately write the system \eqref{eq:un:poissonfem} as a linear equation ``$A \bu = \bb$'', but we will not do that immediately.  Following the pattern established since Chapter \ref{chap:nl}, we first implement a residual-evaluation function, corresponding to \eqref{eq:un:poissonfem}, within a \PETSc \pSNES instance.  This implementation can immediately be tested with finite-differenced Jacobian.  Once it works we can, and we will, consider matrix assembly.  Before any of that can be accomplished, however, we have to \emph{put the mesh itself into \PETSc data structures}.


\section{Triangular meshes from \Triangle}

FIXME from here: \pIS and \pSNES

\PETSc itself does not include any tools for triangulating regions of the plane, sowe use the widely-available and easy-to-use \Triangle\sidenote{See \href{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html}{www.cs.cmu.edu/$\sim$quake/ triangle.html} for documentation and source code. \Triangle may be available as a package in your operating system.} software \citep{Shewchuk1996} for this task.  \Triangle is both limited to planar regions and only capable of writing ASCII files.  Thus it is not a choice for performance, but of convenience.

\Triangle uses a simply-formatted ASCII file (extension \texttt{.poly}) as input to describe a polygonal region $\Omega$, and to indicate Dirichlet and Neumann portions of the boundary $\partial \Omega$.  For example, consider the input file \texttt{bump.poly} shown in Code \ref{code:bumppoly}.  This example polygon, a rectangle with a triangular bump in the base, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bump-poly}.  It will reappear several times in this book as we solve more interesting PDEs on it.  The two apparently-unnecessary vertices introduced along the bottom help identify the Neumann part of the boundary, but note that \texttt{bump.poly} includes a Dirichlet/Neumann flag along each boundary segment.

\inputfromline{../c/ch9/blob.poly}{\CODELOC blob.poly}{A description of the boundary polygon in Figure \ref{fig:un:polygon}, suitable for reading by \Triangle.}{8}{code:blobpoly}

The triangulation shown in Figure \ref{fig:triangulation} came from a single command which asks \Triangle to take \texttt{bump.poly} and generate a triangulation which has a polygon output file (option \texttt{-p}), relatively-uniform triangles (option \texttt{-q} for ``quality-checked'' \citep{Shewchuk1996}), and triangles with maximum area of $1.0$ (option \texttt{-a1.0}):
\begin{marginfigure}
%\input{bump.poly.tikz}
\caption{FIXME The polygon described by \texttt{bump.poly} in Code \ref{code:bumppoly}.  The bold part is the closed Dirichlet boundary.  The lower boundary is Neumann, and has ``extra'' nodes to identify it as such.}
\label{fig:bump-poly}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{cline}
$ triangle -pqa1.0 bump
\end{cline}
%$
This command generates three ASCII files, \texttt{bump.1.poly}, \texttt{bump.1.node}, and  \texttt{bump.1.ele}.  These files define the new (i.e.~refined relative to \texttt{bump.poly}) polygonal boundary, the nodes locations, and the elements in the triangulation, respectively.  For example, \texttt{bump.1.node} has the numbering and node locations shown in blue in Figure \ref{fig:triangulation}.

\begin{figure}
%\input{bump.1.tikz}
\caption{FIXME A FEM triangulation generated by \Triangle.  {\color{blue} Nodes} are labeled by $j=0,\dots,N-1$ with $N=24$ and {\color{red} elements} are labeled by $k=0,\dots,K-1$ with $K=32$.}
\label{fig:triangulation}
\end{figure}

\bigskip

\Triangle includes a minimal visualization tool which shows the triangulation graphically.  The command
\begin{cline}
$ showme bump
\end{cline}
%$
displays the boundary polygon (from \texttt{bump.poly} or \texttt{bump.1.poly}) and the triangulation itself (\texttt{bump.1.node} and \texttt{bump.1.ele}).


\section{Getting a triangular mesh from ASCII files into a \PETSc \pVec}

The ASCII files produced by \Triangle produces are not in a good format for large meshes, but we will accept this for portability and readability.  We will, however, demonstrate how files are read in parallel, based on first doing a mundane and un-scalable task in \PETSc, namely reading the ASCII \Triangle files serially onto a single MPI process and writing out a binary file in \PETSc format.\sidenote{Furthermore we will focus on the scalability of the FEM solution process, once the mesh is loaded.}  The binary file both describes the mesh element-by-element and can be read in parallel.

The code \texttt{c3convert.c} does the conversion.  It is invoked, for the present purposes, by
\begin{cline}
$ c3convert -f bump.1
\end{cline}
%$
This reads ASCII files \texttt{bump.1.\{node,ele,poly\}} and writes a \PETSc-formatted binary file \texttt{bump.1.petsc}.

We will not show \texttt{c3convert.c}, but we summarize the high points.  First \PETSc is initialized and we get the rank of the current (MPI) process.  We only ask the first process (``rank zero'') in the MPI communicator to do any work.\sidenote{This code can be invoked ``\texttt{mpiexec -n NN c3convert}'', but it behaves as a serial code.}  This part of the code first reads the header information in the \texttt{.node} file, and allocates \PETSc \pVecs according.  We use \texttt{VecCreateSeq} to allocate the a sequential \pVec \texttt{vx}, which contains the $x$-coordinate of the nodes, only on the rank zero process.  Then \texttt{VecDuplicate} is used to allocate two more \pVecs with the same layout, \texttt{vy} and \texttt{vBT}.  This last \pVec will contain a flag $\{0,2,3\}$ for each node, where $0$ is an interior node, $2$ is a Dirichlet boundary node, and $3$ is a Neumann boundary node.

Then we read the node locations from the \texttt{.node} file.  The reading itself is done with the standard C library call \texttt{fscanf}.  Then \texttt{VecSetValues} is used to set one entry at a time.  After setting these values, which stores a list of entrys into an internal \PETSc dynamic data structure, we ask \PETSc to assemble the \pVecs.

The next part of \texttt{c3convert.c} reads boundary polygon information from the \texttt{.poly} file.  Each segment of the boundary polygon corresponds to two node indices.  We store the segments in a \pVec with blocksize 2.  Then we read the header information in the \texttt{.ele} file and allocates a \pVec called \texttt{vE} for the elements.  This part of the code is an important transformation of the data structures.  In fact, \texttt{vE} has block size 15,\sidenote{A \PETSc \pVec is designed to hold \texttt{double} values.  We are being quite wasteful for integer indices and boolean flags.  FIXME: A \PETSc index set \texttt{IS} should be used.} and, in contrast to the format from \Triangle, it contains all the information about each element that we need to do assemble the matrix equation.  Each of its blocks is the C \texttt{struct} shown in Code \ref{code:elementtype}.

\cinputraw{../c/ch9/readmesh.h}{extract from \texttt{\CODELOC readmesh.h}}{The \texttt{elementtype} struct.}{}{//STARTSTRUCT}{//ENDSTRUCT}{code:elementtype}

In the next part of \texttt{c3convert.c} we fill the \pVec for elements with all of the information read so far, including the node indices for each element which we read from the \texttt{.ele} file.  This stage is fundamentally serial, because we must look at the entire mesh to find the node coordinates and node/segment boundary type for each node and edge of each element.  In this part there is an important detail about triangulations, which affects the data structure for elements.  Namely, we cannot tell if an edge of an element is in the boundary just by whether both endpoints are in the boundary.  For example, the element (triangle) labeled ``5'' in Figure \ref{fig:triangulation} has an edge from node 5 (on the Dirichlet boundary) to node 7 (on the Neumann boundary).  But triangle 5 is \emph{not} a boundary element.  Thus we need to have list of flags for the boundary segments themselves.  Thus the \texttt{elementtype} structure above has both a boundary type for each node of each element and a boundary type for each edge of each element.

At this point we have the whole triangulation into \PETSc \pVecs.  The almost-last part of \texttt{c3convert.c} simply creates a \PETSc ``viewer'' and ``view'' all of the \pVecs which contain the mesh.  We will be able to reread these \pVecs in parallel, as long as we re-read them in the same order.  The final bit of \texttt{c3convert.c} checks if option \texttt{-check} is given, and if so we read back the binary file in parallel.  This part of \texttt{c3convert.c} calls two methods from a separate code (and re-used component) \texttt{readmesh.c} (Codes \ref{code:readmeshpartone} and \ref{code:readmeshparttwo}).

The first method \texttt{getmeshfile()} finds a \PETSc binary file from the \texttt{-f} option.  The other major method \texttt{readmesh()}, in Code \ref{code:readmeshparttwo}, creates and reads three \pVecs in parallel from it, using utility methods \texttt{createloadname()} and \texttt{getcheckmeshsizes()}.  Note that prefixes are set on each \pVec so that the block size is correctly read.

\section{Constructing the FEM linear system}

Now that we can get a triangulation into \PETSc, we can return to the finite-dimensional weak formulation \eqref{poissonfem}.  This linear system
\begin{equation}
A \bu = \bb, \label{poissonmatrix}
\end{equation}
has $A\in\RR^{N\times N}$ and $\bu,\bb\in\RR^N$, where $N$ is the number of nodes.  We will write a code which assembles $A$ and $\bb$ and solves for $\bu$.  \PETSc \pMat and \pVec objects store the problem, and we use a \pKSP object to solve it.

For ease of construction we include the node-wise Dirichlet conditions $u_j=g(\bx_j)$ as equations in this linear system, treating such $u_j$ as unknowns, so that the matrix has $N$ rows and columns if there are $N$ nodes in total.  Thus we define $A$ to have entries
\begin{equation}
a_{ij} = \int_\Omega \grad \psi_j \cdot \grad \psi_i \label{Aentryfem}
\end{equation}
if $\bx_i \notin \partial_D \Omega$ and $\bx_j \notin \partial_D \Omega$, while otherwise
\begin{equation*}
a_{ij} = \delta_{ij}.
\end{equation*}
Notice that we index rows and columns of matrices and vectors starting with zero,\sidenote{This follows C and \PETSc conventions, but is opposed to long-standing traditions about linear algebra!} and that $j=0,1,\dots,N-1$ in particular.

Observe that $A$ is \emph{symmetric}, $a_{ij}=a_{ji}$.  Furthermore $A$ is \emph{sparse}, that is, most entries are zero, at least for triangulations with more than a handful of triangles.  These facts affect the algorithms we choose when solving \eqref{poissonmatrix}.

For the right side of \eqref{poissonfem}, define the entries
\begin{equation}
    b_i = \int_\Omega f \psi_i + \int_{\partial_N\Omega} \gamma \psi_i - \sum_{l=0,\dots,L} g(\bx_{j_l})  \int_\Omega \grad \psi_{j_l} \cdot \grad \psi_i  \label{bentryfem}
\end{equation}
if $\bx_i \notin \partial_D \Omega$, while if $\bx_i \in \partial_D \Omega$ then
    $$b_i = g(\bx_{i}).$$

In practice we \emph{don't} initially build $A$ or $\bb$ as described above.  We start with a matrix $\tilde A$ and vector $\tilde \bb$ which have the same size as $A$ and $\bb$, respectively, but which ignore the Dirichlet boundary.  We don't even evaluate the function $g$.  All entries of $\tilde A$ are computed by the first formula above for $a_{ij}$, that is, the entries are
\begin{equation*}
\tilde a_{ij} = \int_\Omega \grad \psi_i \cdot \grad \psi_j
\end{equation*}
for all $i,j=0,1,\dots,N$.  Also the simpler right-hand side $\tilde \bb\in\RR^N$ has entries
    $$\tilde b_i = \int_\Omega f \psi_i + \int_{\partial_N\Omega} \gamma \psi_i$$
for all $i=0,1,\dots,N$.

This initial linear system $\tilde A\bu=\tilde \bb$ is (obviously) final in the case where there is no Dirichlet boundary (i.e.~$\partial_D \Omega=\emptyset$).  However, in this case $u=C$, where $C\in\RR$ is any constant value, solves $-\grad^2 u=0$ with $\partial u/\partial n = 0$ on the whole boundary $\partial_N \Omega = \partial \Omega$.  The Poisson problem then only determines the solution up to such an additive constant.  Because it does not have a unique solution, when solving \eqref{poissonmatrix} in this Neumann case we will have to inform \PETSc about the null space of constant functions.

In general, the next step is to edit $\tilde A$ in each Dirichlet row, that is, for each $i$ where $\bx_i \in \partial_D \Omega$.  For each such row we replace the whole row with the corresponding row of the identity, and also we replace $\tilde b_i$ with $b_i = g(\bx_i)$.  Furthermore, in each column $j$ for which $\bx_j \in \partial_D \Omega$, we move all entries $\tilde a_{ij}$ where $i$ is \emph{not} a Dirichlet row index over to the right-hand side, multiplied by the negative of the boundary value $g(\bx_{j})$.  We can write
\begin{equation}
    \tilde b_i \to \tilde b_i - g(\bx_{j}) \tilde a_{ij} \label{btransform}
\end{equation}
for these transformations.  After the completion of this ``editing'' stage we get $A$ and $\bb$.  Since this part of the matrix assembly is a key stage in our FEM codes, we now give a concrete example.

\begin{example} Figure \ref{fig:squarefour} shows a triangulation of the unit square with five nodes.  The matrix $\tilde A$ has the following nonzero pattern; the zero entries are shown as spaces:\begin{marginfigure}

Note $\tilde a_{ij}=0$ only where the integral $\int_\Omega \grad \psi_j \cdot \grad \psi_i$ is zero, a rare event in this small (coarse)-mesh case.  Now, because the $i=1,2$ nodes live in the (closed) Dirichlet boundary $\partial_D \Omega$, we highlight the $i=1,2$ rows and $j=1,2$ columns which will be edited:\marginnote{{\color{red} \textbf{Caution}}:  The first row or column of any matrix in this book is numbered ``$0$.''}

The underlined {\color{blue} blue} entries are changed to $0$ or $1$ so that these rows become rows of the identity; the old computed values $\tilde a_{ij}$ are tossed out.

\section{Assembling the matrix equation, element by element}

An entry $\tilde a_{ij}$ of the initial matrix $\tilde A$ is not computed in one step.  Rather, we compute contributions to these entries from each element in turn; we ``loop over the elements.''  Furthermore we do it in parallel.  Recall that \texttt{c3convert.c} above creates a distributed \pVec called \texttt{E}, which is an array of elements of type \texttt{elementtype}, and \texttt{readmesh.c} reads it.

For the element-by-element assembly procedure we first define the integral over one triangle $\triangle_k$,
\begin{equation}
\text{\texttt{a(k,i,j)}} = \int_{\triangle_k} \grad \psi_i \cdot \grad \psi_. \label{aelementintegral}
\end{equation}
so that
    $$\tilde a_{ij} = \sum_k \phantom{.}\text{\texttt{a(k,i,j)}}.$$
Likewise we will compute
\begin{equation}
\text{\texttt{b(k,i)}} = \int_{\triangle_k} f \psi_i + \int_{\overline{\triangle}_k \cap \partial_N\Omega} \gamma \psi_i, \label{belementintegral}
\end{equation}
so that $\tilde b_i = \sum_{k} \;\text{\texttt{b(k,i)}}$.

If \texttt{E} denotes an array of \texttt{elementtype} then for each triangle $\triangle_k$ we can get the node index for each of its three vertices.  Using $q=0,1,2$ for these vertices,
    $$\text{\texttt{E[k].j[q]}} \in \{0,1,\dots,N-1\}.$$
Thus the element-by-element assembly of $\tilde A$ follows this pseudocode:
\begin{code}
A = 0                           // N x N sparse matrix with entries a(i,j)
b = 0                           // N x 1 column vector with entries b(i)
for k = 0 to K-1                // loop through all elements
    for q = 0 to 2
        i = E[k].j[q]           // row index
        for r = 0 to 2
            j = E[k].j[r]       // column index
            a(i,j) += a(k,q,r)  // add contribution from element k
            b(i)   += b(k,q)    // ditto
\end{code}
\medskip\noindent
Observe that on each triangle $\triangle_k$ we write ``\texttt{a(k,q,r)}'' for \texttt{a(k,i,j)}, by replacing the global indices $i,j$ by corresponding local node indices $q,r\in\{0,1,2\}$ for triangle $k$.

A standard approach to computing the element-wise integrals \texttt{a(k,q,r)} is to refer triangle $\triangle_k$ to a reference triangle $\triangle_\ast$ with vertices $(0,0),\,(1,0),\,(0,1)$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:isoparametric}.  The linear map from $\triangle_\ast$ to $\triangle_k$ with vertices $(x_0,y_0),\,(x_1,y_1),\,(x_2,y_2)$, as shown in the Figure, is
\begin{align}
x(\xi,\eta) &= x_0 + (x_1-x_0) \xi + (x_2-x_0) \eta, \label{trianglemap} \\
y(\xi,\eta) &= y_0 + (y_1-y_0) \xi + (y_2-y_0) \eta. \notag
\end{align}

\begin{marginfigure}
\input{tikz/isoparametric.tex}
\caption{Mapping of a triangle $\triangle_k$ from the reference triangle $\triangle_\ast$.}
\label{fig:isoparametric}
\end{marginfigure}

\noindent Furthermore, on $\triangle_\ast$ any linear function is a linear combination of these three local basis functions:
\begin{equation}
\chi_0(\xi,\eta) = 1-\xi-\eta, \qquad \chi_1(\xi,\eta) = \xi, \qquad \chi_2(\xi,\eta) = \eta. \label{chiformulas}
\end{equation}
On $\triangle_k$, each of the basis functions $\psi_q$ is the mapped version of the corresponding $\chi_q$:
\begin{equation}
\psi_q(x(\xi,\eta),y(\xi,\eta)) = \chi_q(\xi,\eta). \label{phichimap}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{trianglemap} and \eqref{phichimap} one can confirm that $\psi_q(x_r,y_r) = \delta_{qr}$.

Now is a good point at which to observe that the set of $\psi_j$, over all nodes $j=0,1,\dots,N$, is a partition of unity.  We can see this by switching to local node coordinate $q$ and using $\chi_0+\chi_1+\chi_2=1$, which is obvious from \eqref{chiformulas}.  That is, if $\bx \in \triangle_k$ then
\begin{equation}
   \sum_j \psi_j(\bx) = \sum_{q=0,1,2} \psi_q(\bx) = \sum_{q=0,1,2} \chi_q =1.  \label{partitionofunity}
\end{equation}

The Jacobian\sidenote{By definition, the \emph{Jacobian} $J=J(\bx)$ of a smooth map $F$ at a point $\bx$ is its linearization at $\bx$.  That is, if $\by=F(\bx)$ and $\by+\Delta\by = F(\bx+\Delta\bx)$ then $J(\bx)$ satisfies $\Delta \by = J(\bx) \Delta\bx + o(|\Delta\bx|)$.} of map \eqref{trianglemap} is
% CAUTION: Elman (1.37) uses "Jacobian" for the transpose of this, the true Jacobian (e.g. in Newton later)
\begin{equation}
J = \begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \xi} & \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \eta} \\[1.0em]
    \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \xi} & \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \eta}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1-x_0 & x_2-x_0 \\
    y_1-y_0 & y_2-y_0
    \end{bmatrix}.  \label{trianglejacobian}
\end{equation}
Recalling both the change-of-variables formula for integrals\sidenote{If $F$ is a smooth map from $\bx \in U$ to $\by \in F(U)$, $J$ is the Jacobian of $F$, and $g$ is integrable on $F(U)$, then $$\int_{F(U)} g(\by)\,d\by = \int_U g(F(\bx))\,|\det(J)|\,d\bx.$$} and the chain rule, by \eqref{phichimap} we can write
\begin{align}
\text{\texttt{a(k,q,r)}} &= \int_{\triangle_k} \grad\psi_q \cdot \grad\psi_r \label{elementcontrib} \\
   &= \int_{\triangle_k} \frac{\partial\psi_q}{\partial x} \frac{\partial\psi_r}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial\psi_q}{\partial y} \frac{\partial\psi_r}{\partial y} \; dx \, dy  \notag \\
   &= \int_{\triangle_\ast} \left(\frac{\partial \chi_q}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \chi_q}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\right) \left(\frac{\partial \chi_r}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \chi_r}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\right) \notag \\
   &\qquad\qquad + \left(\frac{\partial \chi_q}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \chi_q}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}\right) \left(\frac{\partial \chi_r}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \chi_r}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}\right) \; |\det(J)| \; d\xi \, d\eta. \notag
\end{align}
The last expression is the low point of this calculation.  From now on the formulas simplify because the integrand is \emph{constant} for the $\Pone$ elements here.  Indeed, by \eqref{trianglejacobian} we see $\det(J)$ is constant, but also the derivatives $\partial \chi_q/\partial\{\xi,\eta\}$ and $\partial\{\xi,\eta\}/\partial\{x,y\}$ are all constant because the functions in question are linear.

However, we need computable formulas for ``$\partial \xi/\partial x$'' and similar terms.  Again by the chain rule we can compute
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\[0.2em]
    0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial y} \\[1.0em]
    \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \xi} & \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \eta} \\[1.0em]
    \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \xi} & \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \eta}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial \xi}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial \xi}{\partial y} \\[1.0em]
    \dfrac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
which is to say $I=J\; J^{-1}$.  On the other hand we can invert the $2\times 2$ matrix $J$ by hand to get
\begin{equation}
J^{-1}
= \frac{1}{\det(J)}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \eta} & -\dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \eta} \\[1.0em]
    -\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial \xi} & \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial \xi}
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{\det(J)}
\begin{bmatrix}
    y_2-y_0 & x_0-x_2 \\
    y_0-y_1 & x_1-x_0
\end{bmatrix}.  \label{Jinverse}
\end{equation}
Now let $y_{20}=y_2-y_0$, $x_{02}=x_0-x_2$, $y_{01}=y_0-y_1$ and $x_{10}=x_1-x_0$.  In terms of these differences,
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial \xi}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial \xi}{\partial y} \\[1.0em]
    \dfrac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} & \dfrac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{\det(J)}
\begin{bmatrix}
    y_{20} & x_{02} \\
    y_{01} & x_{10}
\end{bmatrix} \label{dxietadxy}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\det(J) = x_{10} y_{20} - y_{01} x_{02}. \label{detJ}
\end{equation}
Thus, by \eqref{elementcontrib}, \eqref{dxietadxy}, and \eqref{detJ}, and because the area of the reference triangle $\triangle_\ast$ is $1/2$\,, our element-wise contribution to $\tilde a_{ij}$ simplifies to
\begin{align}
\text{\texttt{a(k,q,r)}} = \frac{1}{2\; |\det(J)|} &\bigg[\left(\frac{\partial \chi_q}{\partial \xi} y_{20} + \frac{\partial \chi_q}{\partial \eta} y_{01}\right) \left(\frac{\partial \chi_r}{\partial \xi} y_{20} + \frac{\partial \chi_r}{\partial \eta} y_{01}\right) \label{elementcontribFINAL} \\
&\quad + \left(\frac{\partial \chi_q}{\partial \xi} x_{02} + \frac{\partial \chi_q}{\partial \eta} x_{10}\right) \left(\frac{\partial \chi_r}{\partial \xi} x_{02} + \frac{\partial \chi_r}{\partial \eta} x_{10}\right)\bigg]. \notag
\end{align}
Also note that
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \chi_0}{\partial \xi} &= -1, & \frac{\partial \chi_1}{\partial \xi} &= 1, & \frac{\partial \chi_2}{\partial \xi} &= 0, \label{chiderivs} \\
\frac{\partial \chi_0}{\partial \eta} &= -1, & \frac{\partial \chi_1}{\partial \eta} &= 0, & \frac{\partial \chi_2}{\partial \eta} &= 1. \notag
\end{align}
Combining \eqref{elementcontribFINAL} and \eqref{chiderivs}, we know enough to write code to compute \texttt{a(k,q,r)}, and thus the entries in $\tilde A$.

To complete the code for the initial linear system $\tilde A \bu = \tilde\bb$ we also need to address the right-hand side $\tilde\bb$, that is, we need to compute the element-wise contribution \texttt{b(k,i)} in \eqref{belementintegral}.  We do these integrals by changing variables to the reference element, but we also only do the integrals approximately by quadrature.  This is because the data $f$ and $\gamma$ may have no analytically-computable integral, and because a modest error in evaluating the right side of the linear system can have only a small effect on the solution of the FEM linear system, which is, after all, only an approximation of the solution of the Poisson problem.

FIXME: in the homogeneous Neumann case ($\gamma=0$) we use midpoints of the edges of the triangles in our quadrature rule from \citet{Ciarlet2002}
\begin{align*}
\text{\texttt{b(k,q)}} &= \int_{\triangle_\ast} f\, \chi_q \; |\det(J)| \; d\xi \, d\eta \\
  &\approx \frac{|\det(J)|}{6} \left(\omega(0.5,0) + \omega(0.5,0.5) + \omega(0,0.5)\right)
\end{align*}
where $\omega(\xi,\eta) = f(x(\xi,\eta),y(\xi,\eta)) \chi_q(\xi,\eta)$.

>What's the status on the implementation of the parallel

I am actually developing a parallel loader. The loader has two steps:

(1) Use 1 core or several cores to read a sequential  mesh, and partition
it into $np$ parts using a partitioner, $np$ is the number of cores you
want to use to do a simulation. Usually, $np$ is large, for example, 10,000
cores. And then we write the partitioned data into the file system as a
HDF5 file.

(2) Load the partitioned data (HDF5 file) into $np$ cores in parallel.

This idea works pretty well for me at this point.  But, this loader is
not compatible with DMPlex now. However, I could change the code somehow,
If this idea is acceptable.

You could also implement it by yourself. It is not too bad.

Parallel generator is highly nontrivial, I think. It is a very hard topic.
