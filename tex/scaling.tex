\section{Weak and strong scaling}

FIXME: define weak and strong scaling

\section{Assessing our performance with event-logging and \texttt{-log\_summary}}

\vspace{4cm}

FIXME: also we can put a structured grid in the unstructured code

\begin{marginfigure}
\input{mesh.1.tikz}
\caption{A structured triangulation of the unit square with $K=32$ triangles and $N=25$ nodes.  The entire boundary is Dirichlet in the problem we consider.}
\label{fig:structuredfem}
\end{marginfigure}

FIXME: use CG

\section{Classical preconditioners}

FIXME:  ILU?  block Jacobi and GS?

\section{Domain-decomposition preconditioners}

FIXME: ASM?

\section{Multigrid preconditioners}

FIXME: just show what we have already

FIXME: perhaps add 3D poisson

\caveat{But real-world PDEs are nonlinear.}
