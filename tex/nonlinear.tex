FIXME: somewhere in here we get to an idea that is most relevant to nonlinear problems: experimentation with linear solvers (i.e.~inside Newton) is obligatory because examples of linear systems can be found so that any solver comes out faster than any other \citep{Nachtigaletal1992} and examples of linear systems can be found so that well-known Krylov solvers like GMRES can be made to converge at any rate \citep{Greenbaumetal1996}
