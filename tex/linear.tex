\section{A finite element method for the Poisson problem}

Let $\Omega \subset \RR^d$ be a region.  (Only $d=2$ and $d=3$ are used in this book.)  Suppose its boundary is decomposed into well-behaved subsets $\partial_D \Omega$ and $\partial_N \Omega$ whose union is the entire boundary $\partial \Omega$.  The \emph{Poisson problem}, in strong form and including nonhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, is
\begin{align}
- \grad^2 u &= f \quad \text{ on } \Omega, \label{poissonstrong} \\
u &= g \quad \text{ on } \partial_D \Omega, \notag \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &= \gamma \quad \text{ on } \partial_N \Omega \notag
\end{align}
where $\partial u/\partial n = \bn \cdot \grad u$ and $\bn$ is the outward unit normal on $\partial \Omega$.\marginnote{%

The data of problem \eqref{poissonstrong}, besides the region $\Omega$ and its boundary, is a \emph{source term} $f\in L^2(\Omega)$, \emph{Dirichlet data} $g\in L^2(\partial_N \Omega)$, and \emph{non-homogeneous Neumann data} $\gamma\in L^2(\partial_N \Omega)$.  For simplicity, and so that the solution of this problem is unique \citep{Elmanetal2005}, we assume $\partial_D \Omega$ has positive measure.  All of our examples will have that property.

The Poisson problem models the distribution of temperature in a conducting object at steady state, the electrostatic potential, the equilibrium distribution from certain random walks, and many other other physical phenomena.  And it is linear, that is, if $u_1$ and $u_2$ are solutions then convex linear combinations are also solutions.  More relevantly, it is a linear problem in the sense that finite-dimensional approximations of the Poisson problem are simply matrix problems.

As \eqref{poissonstrong} is stated there may be no solution where ``$\grad^2 u$'' makes sense as a function, even for ``nice'' boundary and source functions.  In particular, there may be no $u\in C^2(\Omega)$ which is continuous up to the boundary (i.e.~$u\in C(\bar\Omega)$).  There is, however, a unique solution\sidenote{Many mathematical concepts, including a well-posedness proof that justifies this claim, are all covered by \citep{Evans}.  These are technicalities for us.  Our goal is computational performance in cases where the Poisson problem is mathematically well-behaved.} if we change to a \emph{weak formulation}.  We will state the weak formulation after defining function spaces.

Define
    $$H^1(\Omega) = \{u\in L^2(\Omega) \big| \grad u \text{ exists a.e.~and } \grad u \in L^2(\Omega)\},$$
which is a Sobolev space \citep{Evans}.  This space has two subsets we will use, namely functions with value $g$ and those with value $0$ on $\partial_D \Omega$, respectively, which we denote $H_g^1(\Omega)$ and $H_0^1(\Omega)$.  Note that $H_0^1(\Omega)$ is a linear subspace of $H^1(\Omega)$ while $H_g^1(\Omega)$ is, in the general case $g\ne 0$, not a subspace, because the zero function is not in it.  Nonetheless, from now on we refer to both $H_g^1(\Omega)$ and $H_0^1(\Omega)$ as ``subspaces''.

The weak formulation of the Poisson problem comes from choosing any $v\in H_0^1(\Omega)$, multiplying the first equation in \eqref{poissonstrong} by $v$, and integrating by parts:
\begin{equation*}
\int_\Omega \grad u \cdot \grad v - \int_{\partial\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v = \int_\Omega f v.
\end{equation*}
Now,\marginnote{%
{\color{red}Main ideas} of strong and weak formulations:\begin{itemize}
\item If $u \in H_g^1(\Omega)$ solves the strong form \eqref{poissonstrong} then it solves \eqref{poissonweak} also.
\item If $u \in H_g^1(\Omega)$ solves the weak form \eqref{poissonweak} then we accept it, by definition, as a solution of the Poisson problem.\end{itemize}} supposing we already have a classical solution $u$ of \eqref{poissonstrong}, which is in $H_g^1(\Omega)$, we apply the other facts, namely that $v=0$ on $\partial_D\Omega$ and that there is Neumann data on $\partial_N\Omega$:
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \grad u \cdot \grad v = \int_\Omega f v + \int_{\partial_N\Omega} \gamma v\quad \text{ for any } v\in H_0^1(\Omega). \label{poissonweak}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{poissonweak} is the weak formulation of the Poisson problem.  A key observation is that $u$ itself incorporates the Dirichlet boundary condition, because it lives in $H_g^1(\Omega)$, while Neumann boundary data $\gamma$, like the source function $f$, appears in equation \eqref{poissonweak}.

The \emph{finite element method} (FEM) comes from requiring the weak formulation  \eqref{poissonweak} to be true for $u$ in a smaller, indeed finite-dimensional, subspace of $H_g^1(\Omega)$, and for $v$ also in a finite-dimensional subspace of $H_0^1(\Omega)$; this is a \emph{Galerkin} FEM.  We will build these finite-dimensional subspaces, in the current example, using a \emph{unstructured triangulation} on a region $\Omega\subset \RR^2$

To make this work, from now on in this chapter we restrict to $d=2$ dimensions and we require that $\Omega$ be polygonal, with boundary $\partial\Omega$ a closed polygon.  We require that the sides of $\Omega$ each have positive length, and be either entirely in $\partial_D\Omega$ or in $\partial_N\Omega$.  As before, to produce a unique solution we require that $\partial_D\Omega$ contain at least one such side.

\begin{marginfigure}
\input{samplepoly.1.tikz}
\caption{A triangulation $\Th$ with $K=22$ triangles (elements) numbered $k=0,1,\dots,K-1$ ({\color{red} red}) and $N=16$ nodes numbered $j=0,1,\dots,N-1$  ({\color{blue} blue}).  Nodes $\bx_0$, $\bx_1$, $\bx_2$, $\bx_3$ are in the Dirichlet boundary $\partial_D\Omega$.}
\label{fig:number-elements}
\end{marginfigure}

A triangulation is a set of non-overlapping, non-empty open triangles $\Delta_k$ which tile $\Omega$:
\begin{equation*}
\Th = \left\{\Delta_k \quad\Big|\quad \cup_k \overline{\Delta}_k = \overline{\Omega} \quad \text{ and} \quad \Omega_k \cap \Omega_l = \emptyset \text{ if } k\ne l\right\}.
\end{equation*}
There are $K$ triangles indexed $k=0,\dots,K-1$; see Figure \ref{fig:number-elements}.  The subscript ``$h$'' in $\Th$ is traditional; it denotes the typical or maximum size $h$ (e.g.~diameter) of the triangles.  It serves as a reminder that we want to solve the Poisson problem accurately, that is, in the limit $h\to 0$.

We informally call the triangles \emph{elements}, though there is more to the definition of ``element,'' as we now explain.  We are going to approximate the Poisson problem with $\Pone$ finite elements, which means that our finite-dimensional subspace contains only piecewise-linear functions which are linear on each triangle.  First, we index\sidenote{In contrast to \citet{Elmanetal2005}, which implements in \Matlab, our indexing is always zero-based, as we code in C.} all the vertices (nodes) in the triangulation with $j=0,1,\dots,N$:
\begin{equation*}
\bx_j = (x_j,y_j)
\end{equation*}
For each $j$ there is a $\Pone$ basis function, or ``hat'' function, $\phi_j(x,y)$ which is linear on each element and equal to one on only one node $j$:\marginnote{%

\end{tikzpicture}
}%
\begin{equation*}
\phi_j(\bx_i) = \delta_{ij}.
\end{equation*}
The functions $\phi_j(x,y)$ are in $H^1(\Omega)$, with piecewise-constant derivatives, and they are obviously linearly-independent also.
Inside an element, $\phi_j$ has three degrees of freedom:
\begin{equation*}
\phi_j(x,y) = A_k + B_k x + C_k y \quad \text{ on } \Delta_k.
\end{equation*}

We can use these basis functions to approximate the Dirichlet data $g$.  First index the $L$ nodes which are in the Dirichlet boundary: $\bx_{j_l} \in \partial_D\Omega$ for $l=0,\dots,L-1$.  (Figure \ref{fig:number-elements} shows an example with $L=4$ and $j_l=l$ for $l=0,1,2,3$.)  Then define the piecewise-linear interpolant of $g$ as this function which extends to all of $\Omega$ in a piecewise-linear way:
\begin{equation*}
\hat g(x,y) = \sum_{l=0,\dots,L} g(\bx_{j_l}) \phi_{j_l}(x,y).
\end{equation*}

Next, by using $\hat g$ and the basis functions $\phi_j$, we can describe three finite-dimensional subsets of $H^1(\Omega)$.  They are defined as the span of basis functions:\sidenote{Traditionally, basis functions for $S_g^h$, where $u_h$ lives, are called the \emph{trial} functions, and basis functions for $S_0^h$ are called \emph{test} functions.  We will generally just give the labels $S_g^h$/$S_0^h$ instead of using the trial/test language.}
\begin{align*}
S^h &= \Span\{\phi_j \,\big|\, \text{ all } j\,\}, \\
S_0^h &= \Span\{\phi_j \,\big|\, \bx_j \notin \partial_D \Omega\}, \\
S_g^h &= S_0^h + \hat g.
\end{align*}
Then $\dim(S^h)=N$ while $\dim(S_0^h)=\dim(S_g^h)=N-L$.

The finite element method we choose requires that the weak formulation  \eqref{poissonweak} be true of $u_h\in S_g^h$ for all $v\in S_0^h$.  Thus we first write $u_h$ in the basis using $N-L$ unknown coefficients $u_j$,
\begin{equation*}
u_h(x,y) = \hat g(x,y) + \sum_{j\big|\bx_j \notin \partial_D \Omega} u_j \phi_j(x,y).
\end{equation*}
Then we require that the weak formulation hold for a basis of $S_0^h$:
\begin{align}
\sum_{j\big|\bx_j \notin \partial_D \Omega} u_j \int_\Omega \grad \phi_j \cdot \grad \phi_i &= \int_\Omega f \phi_i + \int_{\partial_N\Omega} \gamma \phi_i \label{poissonfem} \\
&\qquad - \sum_{l=0,\dots,L} g(\bx_{j_l})  \int_\Omega \grad \phi_{j_l} \cdot \grad \phi_i \notag
\end{align}
for all $i$ such that $\bx_i \notin \partial_D \Omega$.  The coefficients $u_j$, for all $j$ such that $\bx_j \notin \partial_D \Omega$, are unknown.

The finite-dimensional weak formulation \eqref{poissonfem} is simply a matrix equation.  For ease of construction we will include the node-wise Dirichlet conditions into this matrix problem.  Let $A \in \RR^{N\times N}$ have entries
\begin{equation*}
a_{ij} = \int_\Omega \grad \phi_j \cdot \grad \phi_i,
\end{equation*}
if (FIXME: $i$ and $j$ are not Dirichlet ...)
and $\bb\in \RR^N$ have entries
\begin{equation*}
b_i = \int_\Omega f \phi_i + \int_{\partial_N\Omega} \gamma \phi_i - \sum_{l=0,\dots,L} g(\bx_{j_l})  \int_\Omega \grad \phi_{j_l} \cdot \grad \phi_i.
\end{equation*}
(FIXME: except if $i$ is Dirichlet in which case $b_i=g(\bx_i)$)
Then the FEM soluiton $u_h$ is the function determined by coefficients $u_j$ for $j=0,\dots,N$, which are the entries of $\bu \in \RR^N$, and the FEM equation is
\begin{equation}
A \bu = \bb \label{poissonmatrix}
\end{equation}
in matrix form.
