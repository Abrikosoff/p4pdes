\chapter{2. Linear PDEs: a structured grid example}

We start with the Poisson problem because it is the right place to start.  Though it is a cliche in applied mathematics, in solving it we will use key parts of \PETSc: build a structured grid using a \PETSc \pDMDA, assemble a \pMat and some \pVecs in parallel on this grid, and solve in parallel using a \pKSP object.

\section{A Poisson problem on a square domain}

The \emph{Laplacian}
    $$\grad^2 u = \Div(\grad u) = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$$
of a function $u(x,y)$ almost always appears in a mathematical model because the quantity $u$ is conserved in some sense, and because of an assumption that the gradient $\grad u$ is, up to a coefficient, the flux of $u$ \citep{Ockendonetal2003}.  The divergence ``$\Div$'' factor arises from a connection between a flux integral over a closed surface and an integral over the interior of that surface, namely the divergence (Gauss-Green) theorem \citep[Appendix C]{Evans}.

In the \emph{Poisson equation} the Laplacian of $u$ is equal to a known function.  We will not just solve this one equation on a finite region, however.  We solve a \emph{Poisson problem} including boundary conditions, and the whole problem determines a solution which we will approximate numerically.  Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the open unit square $(0,1)\times(0,1)$.  The following is our Poisson problem for this Chapter;  see Figure \ref{fig:unitsquare}:

  \node at (0.5,-0.1) {$u = 0$};
  \node at (0.5,1.1) {$u = 0$};
  \node at (-0.2,0.5) {$u = 0$};
  \node at (1.2,0.5) {$u = 0$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Our first, simple goal is to solve the Poisson equation on the unit square $\mathcal{S}$, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.}
\label{fig:unitsquare}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{align}
- \grad^2 u &= f \quad \text{ on } \mathcal{S}, \label{poissonsquare} \\
u &= 0 \quad \text{ on } \partial \mathcal{S}. \notag
\end{align}
The boundary of the unit square, denoted ``$\partial\mathcal{S}$'', is simply the union of four (closed) line segments.  The boundary conditions $u=0$ are called ``\emph{homogeneous Dirichlet}.''

The Poisson problem can model the electrostatic potential, the equilibrium distribution from certain random walks, the distribution of temperature in a conducting object at steady state, and many other other physical phenomena.  For example, in the context of heat conduction Fourier's law says $\bq = -k \grad u$, where $k$ is approximately constant if the variation in $u$ is not too large.  Conservation of energy for a solid says $c\rho \partial u/\partial t = - \Div\bq + f$ if $f$ describes a heat source within the domain.  At steady state these facts combine to give $0 = k \grad^2 u + f$, that is, Poisson's equation \eqref{poissonsquare}.  Holding the temperature fixed at zero along the boundary completes the problem.

For this chapter we will suppose that $f(x,y)$ is continuous and bounded on $\mathcal{S}$, so that we can compute its pointwise values.  With our homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, and the assumptions on $f$, standard theory says that $u(x,y)$ exists and is continuous on the closed square $\overline{\mathcal{S}}$ \citep[Theorem 6 in section 5.6]{Evans}.\sidenote{A classical approach to showing existence starts by solving problem \eqref{poissonsquare} by Fourier series.  If $f$ is square-integrable then the coefficients $\hat f$ are square-integrable (Parseval's equality).  Because the Laplacian is elliptic and second-order, the coefficients $\hat u$ are square-integrable even when multiplied by the frequency squared.  By Cauchy-Schwarz, the Fourier series for $u$ is the limit of a sequence of continuous functions on $\overline{\mathcal{S}}$ which converge uniformly, so $u\in C^0(\overline{\mathcal{S}})$.}  Thus there is no ambiguity in the boundary condition ``$u=0$ on $\partial \mathcal{S}$,'' and also we can sensibly discuss the pointwise values $u(x,y)$.

Without any boundary conditions, the Poisson equation $-\grad^2 u = f$ alone is not a well-posed problem because if $u$ is a solution then $v=u+C$ is also a solution for any constant $C$.  (In fact there are constant solutions $w=C$ and many, many more to the Laplace equation $-\grad^2 w = 0$ on $\mathcal{S}$.)  However, with the Dirichlet boundary conditions in \eqref{poissonsquare}, the solution is unique if it exists \citep[Theorem 5 in section 2.2]{Evans}; \citep[subsection 5.2.1]{Ockendonetal2003}.


\section{A finite difference method: build the grid}

Because \eqref{poissonsquare} is a linear problem, finite-dimensional approximations of it are simply linear systems.  The finite-dimensional approximation in this Chapter comes from applying a \emph{finite difference} (FD) method.  In Chapter 3 we will apply a finite element approach instead.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A grid on the unit square $\mathcal{S}$, with $M=5$ and $N=7$.}
\label{fig:unitsquaregrid}
\end{marginfigure}

To start our FD method we put a \emph{structured grid} of $MN$ points on the unit square, as in Figure \ref{fig:unitsquaregrid}, with spacing $h_x=1/(M-1)$ and $h_y=1/(N-1)$ in the two directions.  The grid locations are $x_i = i\, h_x$ for $i = 0,1,\dots,M-1$ and $y_j = j\, h_y$ and $j=0,1,\dots,N-1$.

The construction of such a two-dimensional (2D) grid, and the distribution of it across processors, will be our first new idea from \PETSc, beyond the basics in Chapter 1.  Consider the lines of code in Figure \ref{code:dmdacreatetwod}.  They create a \PETSc \pDM object\sidenote{``\pDM'' might stand for ``data management'', but perhaps ``distributed mesh'' is better.} for a grid like Figure \ref{fig:unitsquaregrid}.

A \pDM is an abstract type for describing the topology (i.e.~connectedness) of a grid, \emph{and} the way it is distributed across \MPI processes, \emph{and} the way each process can access data from its neighbors.  The specific variable \texttt{da} in Figure \ref{code:dmdacreatetwod} has type ``\pDMDA'', which is the subclass of \pDM s which are structured grids.

The Figure \ref{code:dmdacreatetwod} code will appear in \texttt{c2poisson.c} below, which solves Poisson's problem.  For now, if we do
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
  make c2poisson
  mpiexec -n 4 ./c2poisson -da_grid_x 5 -da_grid_y 7
\end{Verbatim}
then a structured grid will be distributed across the four processes exactly as in Figure \ref{fig:unitsquaregridparallel}.  Neither $M=5$ nor $N=7$ is divisible by two in this case, but \PETSc distributes the four ranks across the $MN=35$ nodes (grid points) as uniformly as possible given that each processor owns a rectangular subgrid.  In fact, the rank $0$ process has the most nodes (12) and rank $3$ has the least (6), so the load is only uniform within a factor of two, but larger grids will be better load-balanced.  \PETSc does the best it can.

\end{marginfigure}

The fifth and sixth arguments ``\texttt{-10}'' to \texttt{DMDACreate2d()} in Figure \ref{code:dmdacreatetwod} are used to set default dimensions $M=10$ and $N=10$.  We have seen that these defaults are overridden by runtime options \texttt{-da\_grid\_x} and \texttt{-da\_grid\_y}.  However, if we do this,
 \begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
  mpiexec -n 4 ./c2poisson
\end{Verbatim}
then a structured grid will be distributed across the four processes as in Figure \ref{fig:unitsquaregrideight}, with each rank owning 25 nodes.  \PETSc itself can show the parallel layout by calling
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
  mpiexec -n 4 ./c2poisson -dm_view
\end{Verbatim}
or
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
  mpiexec -n 4 ./c2poisson -dm_view draw -draw_pause 2
\end{Verbatim}
The latter version shows the grid graphically, for two seconds.

To explain the other options to \texttt{DMDACreate2d()} used in Figure \ref{code:dmdacreatetwod}, we quote the \PETSc manual pages description of that method:

\item[\texttt{M,N}]	   global dimension in each direction of the array; use \texttt{-M} and or \texttt{-N} to indicate that it may be set to a different value from the command line with \texttt{-da\_grid\_x <M> -da\_grid\_y <N>} \\

\item[\texttt{da}]      output: the resulting distributed array object 
\end{itemize}
\normalsize
\noindent\hrulefill
\medskip

In Figure \ref{code:dmdacreatetwod}, the first argument is a serial or parallel \MPI communicator.  In the second and third arguments we have used ``\texttt{DM\_BOUNDARY\_NONE}'' because our Dirichlet boundary condition does not require communication to the next process' domain, nor periodic wrapping.  In the fourth argument we use \texttt{DMDA\_STENCIL\_STAR} because only cardinal neighbors of a grid point are used when forming the matrix; we will address the FD ``stencil'' below.  As already noted, the fifth and sixth arguments set $M=10,N=10$ as override-able grid defaults.  In the next two arguments we indeed use ``\texttt{PETSC\_DECIDE}'' to have \PETSc parallel-decompose our grid according to the size of (i.e.~number of processes in) the \MPI communicator.  The next two arguments, in the ninth and tenth positions, say that our PDE is scalar (\texttt{dof}$=1$) and that the FD method only needs one neighbor in each direction (\texttt{s}$=1$).  The next two arguments are \texttt{NULL} because we are \emph{not} telling \PETSc how to distribute processes over the grid; it \texttt{DECIDE}s for itself.  Finally, the \pDMDA object is created as an output.

The call to \texttt{DMDASetUniformCoordinates()} in Figure \ref{code:dmdacreatetwod} sets the domain to be $[0,1]\times[0,1]$.  The last two arguments are ignored in this case but would set limits on the third dimension in 3D.

To wrap up our coverage of creating grids, the standard \PETSc view of what \pDM s ``look like'' is in Figure \ref{fig:petscghostvalues}.  On the left is a version of what we have done in the code in Figure \ref{code:dmdacreatetwod}, namely create a structured grid \pDM.  The one shown in Figure \ref{fig:petscghostvalues} has \texttt{DMDA\_STENCIL\_BOX} stencil type, unlike ours.  On the right is an unstructured grid, of the type created in Chapter 3 for the finite element method.  In both cases the figure shows nodes owned by a given process (red ``local'' nodes) and those other nodes that are accessible by the local process (blue ``ghost'' nodes).  We will see such local/ghost node types in all examples in this book.

\section{A finite difference method: assemble the linear system}

Recall we were trying to approximate PDE problem \eqref{poissonsquare}.  Having built a structured grid we can now return to the FD method.

By a well-known Taylor's theorem argument \citep{MortonMayers}, for any function $F(x)$ which is sufficiently smooth, we have
    $$F''(x) = \frac{F(x+h) - 2 F(x) + F(x-h)}{h^2} + O(h^2)$$
as $h$ goes to zero.  This formula, applied to partial derivatives, will give an approximation of the Laplacian in problem \eqref{poissonsquare}.

Let $U_{i,j}$ be the gridded approximation to the exact value $u(x_i,y_j)$ of the solution $u$,\sidenote{This is an important sentence!  We \emph{compute} values $U_{i,j}$ from the finite difference equations.  We generally \emph{don't know} the values of the exact solution on the grid, namely $u(x_i,y_j)$.  Of course we want the former to be close to the latter.}  and also denote $f_{i,j} = f(x_i,y_j)$.  Then we have this FD approximation to problem \eqref{poissonsquare}:
\begin{equation}
- \frac{U_{i+1,j} - 2 U_{i,j} + U_{i-1,j}}{h_x^2} - \frac{U_{i,j+1} - 2 U_{i,j} + U_{i,j-1}}{h_y^2} = f_{i,j}. \label{poissonsquareFDearly}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{poissonsquareFDearly} applies for all of the interior points where $1 \le i \le M-2$ and $1 \le j \le N-2$.  The boundary conditions in \eqref{poissonsquare} become
\begin{equation}
U_{0,j} = 0, \quad U_{M-1,j} = 0, \quad U_{i,0} = 0, \quad U_{i,N-1} = 0, \label{poissonsquareFDbcs}
\end{equation}
for all $i,j$.

At location $(x_i,y_j)$, equation \eqref{poissonsquareFDearly} relates the unknown $U_{i,j}$ to its four cardinal neighbors $U_{i+1,j}$, $U_{i-1,j}$, $U_{i,j+1}$, and $U_{i,j-1}$.  This pattern is a \emph{stencil}, in particular a ``star'' stencil, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:unitsquaregridstencil}.  A ``box'' stencil would also involve all the diagonal neighbors, so an equation using a star stencil relates at most five unknowns in 2D, while one with a box stencil relates at most nine unknowns in 2D.

\end{marginfigure}

Equations \eqref{poissonsquareFDearly} and \eqref{poissonsquareFDbcs} form a linear system of $K=MN$ equations in which we choose to treat all $K$ locations on the grid as unknowns.  To shown this linear system in traditional form
\begin{equation}
A \bu = \bb,
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a $K\times K$ matrix and $\bu,\bb$ are $K\times 1$ column vectors, we must order the unknowns.  This ordering will be used internally by \PETSc in a code that uses a \pDMDA, and we use it here for displaying the system, but the code we will actually write uses the grid-wise coordinates $(i,j)$.  One could write this ordering as
\begin{equation}
    U_k = U_{i,j} \quad \text{ where } \quad k = j\,M + i. \label{orderingfd}
\end{equation}
We will let \PETSc do such index transformations internally, because, as we will see, it has tools for $i,j$-type indexing.  Now is a good time to show the linear system itself, and the ordering, in a small case.

where $a = 2/h_x^2 + 2/h_y^2 = 26$, $b = - 1/h_x^2 = -9$ and $c = - 1/h_y^2 = -4$.

Note that the matrix $A$ is not symmetric, and it is not well-scaled for such a small example.  For instance, its 2-norm condition number \citep{TrefethenBau} is $\cond(A) = \|A\|_2 \|A^{-1}\|_2 = 43.16$.

Before assembling the system, by writing \PETSc code, there are two nontrivial observations about it.  First, the equations \eqref{poissonsquareFDearly} have very different ``scaling'' from those in \eqref{poissonsquareFDbcs}.  For example, if $M=N=1001$, so that $h_x=h_y=0.001$, then the coefficient of $U_{i,j}$ in \eqref{poissonsquareFDearly} is $4/(.001)^2 = 4 \times 10^6$, where as the coefficients of $U_{i,j}$ along the boundary in \eqref{poissonsquareFDbcs} are equal to 1.  Therefore we multiply equation \eqref{poissonsquareFDearly} by the grid cell area $h_x h_y$ to get
\begin{align}
&\left(2 \frac{h_y}{h_x} + 2 \frac{h_x}{h_y}\right) U_{i,j} - \frac{h_y}{h_x}\left(U_{i+1,j} + U_{i-1,j}\right)  - \frac{h_x}{h_y}\left(U_{i,j+1} + U_{i,j-1}\right) \label{poissonsquareFD} \\
&\qquad = h_x h_y f_{i,j}. \notag
\end{align}
Using \eqref{poissonsquareFD}, as long as the cell aspect ratio $\max\{h_y/h_x,h_x/h_y\}$ is not too large, all the equations in the system, including the boundary conditions, will have coefficients of comparable size.  Note that if $h_x=h_y$ then the diagonal entries are equal to $4$ and the off-diagonal entries are $-1$.

Second, our equations can be interpreted to give a \emph{symmetric} matrix $A$.  This opens up a larger range of linear algebra methods for solving the system efficiently.  For example, in the $i=1$ case of \eqref{poissonsquareFD}, i.e.~at a grid point adjacent to the left-hand boundary of the square, the boundary location value $U_{0,j}$ appears in the equation.  The matrix in the linear system will be symmetric if we systematically ``move'' such values to the right-hand side as known (and zero) instead of inserting a ``$1$'' into the corresponding matrix locations.  That is, we make off-diagonal zero entries in the columns corresponding to known boundary values, in addition to the off-diagonal zeros in rows corresponding to known boundary values.  With these two modifications we can redo the above $M=4$ and $n=3$ example.

\begin{example} For the same $M=4$ and $N=3$ case shown in Figure \ref{fig:unitsquaregridordering}, equations \eqref{poissonsquareFDbcs} and \eqref{poissonsquareFD} become
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}

\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha = 2 (h_y/h_x) + 2 (h_x/h_y) = 13/3$ and $\beta = - h_y/h_x = 3/2$.  The matrix is better-scaled, with $\cond(A)=5.83$.
