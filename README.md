A book on using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) for [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation).


### blog and slides

A blog and slides for a course based on the book is started at [bueler.github.io/p4pdes](http://bueler.github.io/p4pdes).  That blog comes from the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/gh-pages) branch of the current repo.


### codes

To compile and run the example C codes, upon which the book is based, see the `README.md` in the [`c/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/c) subdirectory.


### PDF of the book

To compile the draft book into a PDF, see the `README.md` in the [`tex/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/tex) subdirectory.  Or email me at [elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu) and I'll send you a PDF ... just a draft for now.
