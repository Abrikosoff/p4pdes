======

A book on using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) for [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation).  A publication contract is signed with [SIAM Press](http://www.siam.org/books/).

### The codes

To compile and run the example C codes, upon which the book is based, see the `README.md` in the [`c/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/c) subdirectory.  These codes will remain in this location in the long term, and be maintained.

### PDF of the book

To get an incomplete draft PDF, find the `book.pdf` link at [the most recent release](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/releases).  To compile a PDF from the current LaTeX sources, see the `README.md` in the [`tex/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/tex) subdirectory.  However, starting some time in July 2016, development of the book itself will move into a private repo.

### Blog and slides for a course

A preliminary blog and slides for a course based on the book is at [bueler.github.io/p4pdes](http://bueler.github.io/p4pdes).  The blog comes from the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/gh-pages) branch of the current repo.  These materials are not up-to-date with, or as complete as, the content of the book.
