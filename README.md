_PETSc for Partial Differential Equations_ is a book on using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) for numerically solving [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation).

A publication contract for the book has been signed with [SIAM Press](http://www.siam.org/books/).  The development of the book itself, i.e. the LaTeX sources and figure files etc., has been moved into a private repo.

This repository contains the codes upon which the book is based, only C codes at this time.  These codes will remain here for the long term, and be maintained.

### The C codes

To compile and run the example C codes see the `README.md` in the [`c/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/c) subdirectory.

### PDF of the book

A highly-incomplete early draft PDF, containing approximations of the first seven chapters, is at the `book.pdf` link at [the most recent release](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/releases).
