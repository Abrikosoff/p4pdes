_PETSc for Partial Differential Equations_ is a book on using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) for numerically solving [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation).

This repository contains the codes upon which the book is based, which are only C codes at this time.  These codes will remain here for the long term, and be maintained.

The development of the book itself, i.e. the LaTeX sources and figure files etc., has been moved into a private repo.  A publication contract for the book has been signed with [SIAM Press](http://www.siam.org/books/).

### The C codes

To compile and run the example C codes see `README.md` in the [`c/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/c) subdirectory.

### PDF of the book

An early draft PDF, containing approximations of the first seven chapters, is at the `book.pdf` link at [the most recent release](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/releases).  Please contact the author for a more recent PDF draft.
